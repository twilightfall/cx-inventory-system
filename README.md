# cx-inventory-system

This is a WPF inventory/sales tracking system for CX MTG (formerly The Cards of War) that makes use of data from scryfall.com and tcgplayer.com in order to extract and update card price data for the shop's inventory. Data is extracted as json from both sites and processed into SQL Server with the option to create csv files of the database data.
